# Assumption: 
# First time connection is not through public private key pair
# FIrst time connection is always through customeradmin credentials password authentication
# Consequentially, to start with, inventory file will not have details about SSH private key

# Logic: 
# First using the customeradmin credentials, keypair is generated
# The tasks in host provisioning will be done using customeradmin
# For running subsequent install-oracle.sh, customer can then ssh using the ansible user created
# Inventory file may be updated with: ansible_ssh_private_key_file and ansible_ssh_user=ansible
# Prior to calling the next steps (i.e.: install-oracle.sh)
